/**
 * Which Stat Point spreads could have produced this replay.
 *
 * Open Team Sheets publish everything but the spread, so a Pokemon's unknown is
 * six numbers, 0-32 each, at most 66 in total. Inference starts from every legal
 * spread and removes the ones the battle rules out. A spread is removed only when
 * the simulator itself says it could not have produced what the log shows - no
 * damage, speed or HP arithmetic of ours decides anything.
 *
 *   knowledge.mjs  what is still possible per Pokemon, and how a guess is picked
 *   evidence.mjs   one replay of a scaffold, the simulator hooked at every hit,
 *                  HP change and held-item check
 *   speed.mjs      speed order from every sort the simulator makes by speed
 *   infer.mjs      the rounds
 *
 * The replay needs a scaffold - some spread that reproduces the log, so that
 * every hit happens in the position it really happened in. The position does not
 * depend on which consistent spread built it, only the exact HP does, and that is
 * exactly what each candidate tracks for itself. So `inferSpreads` alternates:
 * reconstruct with a guess, collect the evidence up to where it diverged, move
 * the guess inside what survived, and go again until the whole log reproduces.
 * Each round hands the next the exact HP it proved and the dice that rebuild it.
