/**
 * Turn an observed protocol log plus both teams into a replayable input log.
 *
 * A replay records *executions*, never decisions: no seed, no choices, and the
 * opponent's HP only as a Champions percentage. This rebuilds the missing input
 * log by replaying the battle forward one turn at a time and checking its own
 * work as it goes.
 *
 *   1. the simulator says what choice it wants and what is legal
 *      (`side.activeRequest`, ENGINEERING.md 5.7). We only answer "which of the
 *      offered options did the player pick", and the observed log says.
 *   2. the turn is written, and the protocol lines it emitted are compared - in
 *      the same channel the observation came from - against the observed ones.
 *   3. on a mismatch the turn's random draws are settled one at a time, in the
 *      order the simulator consumed them, each against the observed lines. A
 *      draw is only ever moved to another value it could have produced anyway.
 *   4. on exhaustion, back up a turn and redraw: a sampled HP can make the next
 *      turn's observation unreachable.
 *
 * Nothing here computes damage, accuracy, turn order or HP. The only thing this
 * file decides is which choice to write and which face of a die to keep.
 *
 * Searching for a seed that reproduces a whole turn at once costs the *product*
 * of every random event in it, which is why ENGINEERING.md 4 opens by saying
 * seed search was never required. Settling draws one at a time costs their sum.
 * `>editbattle hp` stays rejected: it writes an HP no roll can produce, a log
 * inconsistent with its own seed (ENGINEERING.md 4.3).
